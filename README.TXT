Following on the experience made in ../backus.js


Looking for a name for the language:

FLOW:  http://www.flowlang.net/    -> language name already "occupied" but nothing concrete.  Seems to be obsessed with multi-core, and against GOTO and VARiable reading (instead, add a "timestamp", interesting, remembers Korzibsky). But as said, nothing concrete.

METAGEN: already used in all kinds of ways.

-> drop programming language
-> confusing with dnd

   in-fix metacomposition

infim


imec
imco


DEUX

future work there : ../deux/
